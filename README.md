# hello-world

Hello I am Emilio Sese, I am a first year in Computer Science at the University of Cincinnati.
I love to go to the gym, meditate, journal, read, play piano, play videogames, watch movies and TV. 
My favorite TV show is Cowboy Bebop and my favorite piece of literature is manga Berserk by Kentaro Muira.
Poop pee.
